## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

First, create the required tables by running these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Run additional_tables.sql to create stores, promotions, and banners tables
-- Run sample_dashboard_data.sql to populate with sample data
-- Run sample_cms_data.sql to configure the dashboard layout
```

### 2. Required Tables

The dashboard expects these tables to exist:

- `cms_pages` - For dynamic content management ‚úÖ
- `categories` - For service categories ‚úÖ 
- `stores` - For restaurant/store listings (new)
- `promotions` - For deals and discounts (new)
- `banners` - For promotional banners (new)

### 3. CMS Configuration

The dashboard reads its layout from the `cms_pages` table with `page_key = 'customer_dashboard'`. The content structure should be:

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "section_key": "search",
      "section_title": "Search",
      "layout": "text",
      "is_visible": true,
      "sort_order": 0
    },
    {
      "section_key": "banners",
      "section_title": "Special Offers", 
      "layout": "banner",
      "is_visible": true,
      "sort_order": 1,
      "max_items": 3
    },
    {
      "section_key": "categories",
      "section_title": "What are you looking for?",
      "layout": "pills", 
      "is_visible": true,
      "sort_order": 2,
      "max_items": 8
    },
    {
      "section_key": "popular_nearby",
      "section_title": "Popular near you",
      "layout": "carousel",
      "is_visible": true, 
      "sort_order": 3,
      "max_items": 6,
      "filters": {
        "open_only": true,
        "sort": "rating"
      }
    },
    {
      "section_key": "top_rated", 
      "section_title": "Top rated",
      "layout": "list",
      "is_visible": true,
      "sort_order": 4,
      "max_items": 5,
      "filters": {
        "sort": "rating"
      }
    },
    {
      "section_key": "promotions",
      "section_title": "Today's deals",
      "layout": "carousel",
